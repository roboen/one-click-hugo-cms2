blurb:
  heading: Eynsham Morris
  text: Eynsham Morris have a proud tradition stretching back to the nineteenth
    century and probably beyond. There have been some breaks but we've now put
    more than 40 years of dancing behind us since we restarted! We have some of
    the most exciting and flamboyant dances in the morris tradition, and a
    dancing style to match. We try to live up to Cecil Sharp's description from
    1908 (above).
intro:
  heading: History
  text: Eynsham Morris has a long and distinguished history, which has been
    documented from 1856 and probably stretches back at least two hundred years
    before that. There was a forty-year break in public dancing between 1939 and
    1979, but there has been continuity in tradition through all that time.

      and holidays you'll find us dancing in The Square.

  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
